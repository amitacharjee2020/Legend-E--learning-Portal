Subject: Prayer for increasing library facilities in the school.
Sir,
With due respect , we, the students of your school, have the honour to lay before you the fact that ours is a reputed school in the district. There are about 2000 students in our school. The results of our school in the public examinations are satisfactory. There is no frigate like a book. Books are the best companion in a man’s life. We have a library in our school.  But it is a matter of sorrow that there are not sufficient facilities in our library for lack of which we have been suffering terribly for a pretty long time.  We are badly in need of reference books, English dailies, English story books, renowned magazines & periodicals, ten desks & two fans in our library to ease our reading environment. 
In the circumstances stated above, we fervently pray & hope that your honour would be so kind as to increase the facilities of the library in the school. & oblige there-by.
We remain
Sir
Your most obedient pupils

Sir,
With due respect & humble submission, I beg to state that my father is a petty non-government employee. He is the only earning member of our family which consists of six members. I have also a school going sister. It is very difficult for my father to bear my educational expenses with his small income. In fact, he can hardly afford to meet the necessary expenses of our day to day life. If I am not granted financial help in the form of stipend from the poor fund, I shall have no other alternative than to discontinue my studies. 
In the circumstances stated above, I fervently pray & hope that your honour would be so good as to grant me financial help from the poor fund  to continue my studies & oblige there-by.
I remain

The Deputy Commissioner
Munshiganj
Subject: Request for relief for the flood/cyclone affected people.
Sir,
On behalf of the people of Birtara Union, we beg most respectfully to invite your kind attention to the distress of the people of our area caused by the recent flood/cyclone which  has broken all the records of the past. Never before did water level rise so high nor was the duration so long. Normal activities have been stopped for a pretty long time. Thousands of people have become homeless, foodless and clothless. The miseries of the affected people know no bounds. Crops have been greatly damaged.  Herds of cattle have been washed away. The total estimated loss stands at TK. 50 crore. Thousands of people have taken their shelter on rooftops, boats and embankments. They are now living under the open sky .
Moreover, cholera and other water-borne diseases have broken out in an epidemic form for want of pure drinking water. It has already taken away some valuable lives. So if immediate relief materials and a medical team are not sent for the flood stricken people of this area, the situation may go from bad to worse at any time.
In the circumstances stated above, I, therefore fervently pray and hope that you would be kind enough to send adequate relief materials and a medical team to our flood/cyclone affected area to save the lives of the ill-fated people. For any timely measure, we will remain ever grateful to you.
Thanking you,
Sincerely yours
 The people of Birtara </P>

Computer can be tailored to suit the requirements of the students. As a teaching tool, computers have infinite possibilities. With the use of visuals and audio, learning is a lot lovelier. Difficult subjects can be explained easily by employing modern audio-visual presentations.  Computer is used to access the internet, which is arguably the most extensive library in the world. Computers not only help the students, but they can also be of immense help to the teachers. Teachers can refer to the internet for additional information and reference on the topics to be taught. It can also help them in setting test papers, frame questions and provide project ideas.  Internet offers a wide variety of activities for teachers and widens their horizons. Computers and  internet can help the teachers and institutions in reaching more students. Computers are also a boon to students who are home-bound due to illness or disability. With the use of computers and internet, students can interact with students and institutions across the globe. Students can take up collaborative research and development worldwide. Students get to know of the advancement in their respective fields by interacting with fellow students worldwide. Computers are a great way of storing a significant amount of data without occupying large space. Using computers in schools can eliminate the use of paper. Teacher’s presentations, notes, and test papers can be stored and transferred to computers. Students can submit homework and assignments as soft copies. Data stored in electronic media is also more durable, and most memory devices are reusable. Computer is undoubtedly the best possible aid in education, and its effective use  can prove fruitful to both teachers and students alike.
No more today. I hope you have understood the importance of computer. With best regards to you & your parents.

2.	Write a letter to your friend describing the bad effects of smoking.

My dear Rafi,
 I am sorry to learn that you have become addicted to smoking. It pains me. So I want to let you know about the bad effects of smoking.
People who smoke cigarettes seem to have a higher risk of death from heart disease (and possibly stroke). Studies also show that smokers get more colds, flu, bronchitis, and pneumonia than non-smokers. And people with certain health conditions become sicker if they smoke. Smoking lessens the overall health of smokers. For every premature death caused each year by smoking, there are at least 20 smokers living with a serious smoking-related illness.  Smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, trace minerals and several thousand other compounds. When a cigarette is burning, they create more than 7,000 chemicals. At least 69 of these chemicals are known to cause cancer (carcinogenic), and many are extremely poisonous. These cigarette ingredients include nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, as well as formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, and DDT. Smoke containing nicotine is inhaled into the lungs, and the nicotine reaches your brain in just six seconds. Nicotine in the bloodstream acts to make the smoker feel calm. As a cigarette is smoked, the amount of tar inhaled into the lungs increases, and the last puff contains more than twice as much tar as the first puff. Carbon monoxide makes it harder for red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Tar is a mixture of substances that together form a sticky mass in the lungs. Most of the chemicals inhaled in cigarette smoke stay in the lungs. The more we inhale, the better it feels—and the greater the damage to our lungs. I hope you have understood what I meant to say.

4.	Write a letter to your friend  describing the climate change of Bangladesh
																					                20,March,2018 
                                                                                                                                   K.M.Das Lane , Dhaka-1203
Dear Radin,
 At the outset of my letter, I convey my best love to you. I hope you are keeping fine. In your last letter, you wanted to know about climate change of Bangladesh.  Now I am going to give a short description of it.

Bangladesh is the most vulnerable country in the world to tropical cyclones and the sixth most-vulnerable nation to flooding.  Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh is an extremely crucial issue and Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of Global Climate Change in the coming decades. Bangladesh is watered by a total of 57 trans-boundary rivers coming down to it: 54 from neighbouring India and 3 from Myanmar, and situated at the bottom of the mighty GBM river system (comprising the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna).Nearly a quarter of Bangladesh is less than seven feet above sea level. More than one thousand people are living per sq km with the national population increasing by 2 million people each year. Bangladesh could lose up to 15% of its land area under the sea water and around 30 million people living in the coastal areas of Bangladesh could become Refugees because of climate change impacts. It is estimated that rising sea levels alone will displace 18 million Bangladeshis within the next 40 years. Climate change will affect many sectors, including water resources, agriculture and food security, ecosystems and biodiversity, human health and coastal zones. Many environmental and developmental problems will be worsened by climate change. Predicted rainfall increases, particularly during the summer monsoon, could increase flood-prone areas in Bangladesh. It is predicted that climate change could have devastating impact on agriculture which is a key economic driver in Bangladesh, accounting for nearly 20 percent of the GDP and 65 percent of the labor force. Crop yields are predicted to fall by up to 30 per cent, creating a very high risk of hunger.

5. Suppose, you have a pen friend in abroad. He / She wanted to know about your country. Now, write a letter  describing  the natural beauty of Bangladesh or about your country.

Dear Alin,
Thanks for your letter.   You have wanted to know about our country ( the natural beauties of Bangladesh). Bangladesh is a South Asian country with a tiny area and a big population. We got independence in 1971. Majority people are Muslims.  Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and some tribes live also in this country. We have our own culture and tradition. Bangladesh is enriched with natural beauty. The longest sea beach of Cox’s Bazar , the biggest mangrove forest of Sunderbans, eye catching tea gardens  of Sylhet,  the Buddhist ruins of Maynamati, Mohastangar of Bogra,  Shusong Durgapur of Birishiri etc are famous tourist places in our country. Bangladesh is blessed with huge inland open water resources. It has numerous river canals, beels, lakes, and vast areas of floodplains.  Kuakata, locally known as Sagar Kannya (Daughter of the Sea) is a rare scenic spot located on the southernmost tip of Bangladesh. It is impossible to describe a country in such a short letter. I am inviting you to pay a visit to my beloved country. Visiting our country  you must discover yourself as a part of nature and feel fresh for the boredom of life. So, welcome to our country,  my friend.

No more today. Have a great day

6.Write a letter to your friend about your experience of the visit to a place of historical interest.
										Tikatali, Dhaka								                        24-04-2019
My dear X,
I hope this letter will find you in sound health and vibrant spirits. Recently I have visited Paharpur, a place of historical interest. Now I am giving a short description of it.
I along with some of my friends decided to visit Paharpur’ in Naogaon district of northern Bangladesh during our vacation. On the appointed day,  we reached  the Kamalapur Station. We boarded the 1st class compartment of the train.  After a pleasant journey, we reached our destination. We stayed Naogaon over night. Next morning we went to Paharpur by bus. 
Paharpur is an important archaeological site situated in a village named ‘Paharpur’. Naogoan is mainly plain land but in the middle of it stood a hill covered with jungle. When the jungle was cleared and the hill excavated, there emerged a lofty ruin of an ancient temple. The temple is about 24 metre high from the surrounding level.  The Pala rulers were devout Buddhists and they founded a number of monasteries throughout their growing empire. The site houses the architectural remains of a vast Buddhist monastery, Somapura Mahavihara, covering 27 acres. It was an important intellectual centre for Buddhists , Jains  and Hindus alike. The 21 acre  complex has 177 cells, viharas, numerous stupas, temples and a number of other ancillary buildings. The outside walls with ornamental terracotta palques still display the influence of these three religions. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. This visit gives us immense pleasure.  We returned Dhaka by  bus.  This pleasant experience will remain ever fresh in my mind.

I study till late at night. I am trying my best to improve the position and make up all the deficiency in the weak subject. I have requested my English teacher to help me in the subject. Papa, do not worry because now I have started to work hard with a proper timetable. I give two hours daily to English and am trying to improve my vocabulary and  grammar which are very necessary to learn. I am taking help from my teacher and friends in this respect. My teachers have assured me that I shall get A+ in English in the annual examination. I need your and mother's prayer for my success.

Besides, I have read the text books thoroughly and explored every nook and corner of them. Moreover, the complex questions are already memorized. Mathematics, English, General Science and Arabic are in my daily practice routine. I believe I can do well with any sorts of question. Now I am checking my weak –point.

My dear X,
I hope this letter will find you in sound health and vibrant spirits. Recently I have joined a picnic at Paharpur, a place of historical interest. Now I am giving a short description of it.
We , the students of our class,  desired to go on a picnic. Our head teacher selected Paharpur’ in Naogaon district of northern Bangladesh for our picnic spot. We were accompanied by our class teacher. We hired a bus. On the appointed day, we got into the bus from our school campus. Our bus started early in the morning.  After a pleasant journey, we reached our destination. We stayed Naogaon over night. Next morning we went to Paharpur. Paharpur is an important archaeological site situated in a village named ‘Paharpur’. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.  On reaching the spot, we arranged our cooking. Some of our friends started cooking while some others arranged dance & music.  We finished our lunch at 2 pm. Then we took some rest. At 3 pm  we went to visit  the base of the shrine, more than 60 stone sculptures depicting  a variety of Hindu divinities.  We roamed about in & around the complex for long three hours at a time. we saw the terracotta artworks in the site which  have suffered from serious damage as a result of lack of proper maintenance, shortage of manpower, fund constraint and heavy rainfall. We gathered information about the history of the monastery and took it down in our diary. This visit gave me immense pleasure.  We returned Dhaka at mid night.. Though my visit came to an end, my imagination kept roaming about with my senses. It seemed to me that the time had passed away so swiftly.  This pleasant experience will remain ever fresh in my mind.

On the appointed day, I with two of my cousins will set for our destination. First I will go to the Sadarghat  Inland Water Terminal for  our steamer to be bound for Chandpur. We will  manage to buy business class tickets. We will board the steamer in time.. During the river cruise,  we will  enjoy the scenic beauty of the river.  The murmuring sound of the waves will  thrill us a lot. From the Chandpur Launch Ghat, we will start for our village by CNG.  During my staying there, we will enjoy  much fun & merriment.

 At the outset of my letter, I convey my best love to you. I hope you are keeping fine. In your last letter, you wanted to know how I spent the winter vacation.  Now I am going to give a short description of it.
 During my winter vacation I went to my native village. Ours is a big village.  It is on the bank of the mighty Meghna. The name of our village is Krishnopur. It is in the district of Chandpur.  The village being situated on the river bank is full of scenic beauty. We can enjoy the sun sinking down in the western horizon at sunset.  Apart from river beauty, there are vast greeneries all around. The corn fields, chirping of the birds, the blue sky on moon-lit night –everything seems to be a dreamy world.  On the appointed day, we set for our destination. I accompanied by my father went to the Sadarghat  Inland Water Terminal. Our steamer was bound for Chandpur. We managed to buy a double cabin. We boarded the steamer  & it left for Chandpur on time. I enjoyed the scenic beauty of the river.  The murmuring sound of the waves thrilled me a lot. There was dense fog all around.  The steamer plied slowly in order to avoid collision with other vessels in the river. After four hours,  we reached the Chandpur Launch Ghat. My uncle received us from the ghat. From the Chandpur Launch Ghat, we started for our village by CNG.   On reaching home we took some rest. I have two cousins with whom I enjoyed & gossiped.  During my staying there, I made much fun & merriment. My grandma cooked nice, delicious cakes & paayes  for us. I also drank date juice there. In the village it was very cold. So they made fire with straw to warm us. I went to the riverside with my cousins to watch the boats moving in the river Meghna. My uncle took me to many places of historical & interesting places. In short, I spent my winter vacation amid much fun & pleasure.

17. Write a request letter to librarian to borrow books
Date…
The Librarian
Reference: The Headmaster 
Idea School
Motijheel, Dhaka-1000
Sub: Letter to Librarian to issue books
Dear Sir,
My English teacher told me that our school’s library has the latest version of the required books for preparation. I went to the book store to buy those books but they were not available. Furthermore, my annual is coming near.  I  need “ A Practical English Grammar” by Thomson & Martinet as well as “ Oxford Practice Grammar “ by John Eastwood. I am aware of the fact that according to principles  the library authority  cannot issue more than one book at a time but I request you to kindly grant me permission to issue me  two books. 
You can look into my history that I have frequently issued books from the library and have returned them in time. I assure that after the exam, I will return the books. 
Best regards

18. .Write a letter to your friend describing the Independence Day of Bangladesh
                                                                                                                        Tikatali,Dhaka									                        24-04-2019
My dear X,
How are you? I hope you are fine. I am also fine. The reason of my letter is to let you know about the Independence Day of our country.
16th December is the Independence Day of Bangladesh. We celebrate the day with due solemnity on this day every year. The Whole nation pays tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives during the liberation period of our country. The Pakistani army launched a brutal crackdown on the innocent sleeping Bangalees in the night of 25th March, 1971. This brutal killing led the Bangalees to the war for independence.  On the Day of Independence the Honourable President &  the Honourable Prime Minister of our country give messages to the nation. The government & non-government buildings are illuminated with coloourful lights. Special prayers are offered in religious institutions. Special supplements are published in the leading newspapers of the country. 
No more today. With best regards to your parents.
Yours ever
Y

Dear X,
I am glad to receive your letter. In the letter you have wanted to know about my preparation for the coming examination. I am now writing about it. 
You know that my SSC examination is knocking at the door. I have made a fair progress in my preparation.  I am trying my best to do well in all the subjects. You know that I am weak in mathematics. I am trying to make up my weakness with the help of our mathematics teacher. I have already completed my course entirely and now have been trying to revise them. So, nowadays I am a bit more confident because I have totally a clear understanding of the nature of the question papers in the exam. Besides, I have read the text books thoroughly and explored every nook and corner of them. Moreover, the complex questions are already memorized. Mathematics, English, General Science and Arabic are in my daily practice routine. I believe I can do well with any sorts of question. Now I am checking my weak –point. I am confident that I shall obtain GPA- 5 by the grace of God.
No more today. Please write me about your preparation. Convey my regard to your parents and love to the youngers.
Your loving friend,

 <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Facebook: Its uses and abuses</button> 
<p>Facebook is a social networking website intended to connect friends, family, and business associates. There are many social networking sites in the world, such as Twitter, Linkdin , Instagram etc. But it is the networking website by a long mile . It has more than 2 billion monthly active users. Facebook was founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg and originally called the face book. It began as a college networking website and was quickly successful on campus and expanded beyond Harvard into other schools. At that time, it was only available to schools, universities, organizations, and companies within English speaking countries. Later it was extended to include anyone and everyone.Face book users create a profile page that includes the following: Information, Status, Friends, and Friends in Other Networks, Photos, Notes, Groups, and The Wall. As a result, everyone within that network can view the profile. Users are able to search for friends and acquaintances by e-mail address, school, university, or just by typing in a name or location in search box. When people become friends, they are able to see all of each other’s profiles including contact information. A popular feature on Facebook is to share photographs uploaded from a phone, camera, or computer. A person can make a video call to anyone of his friend list. Now a days business has been largely dependent on Facebook for promotion and marketing. But, with the advantage of Facebook, now days cyber criminals are committing many crimes. Especially the students are getting addicted to facebook. For this creation, students are spending more time on their mobile phone more than ever before. They are becoming increasingly less attentive to their education and studies, and becoming more and more concerned about their fake social life. At the same time immature users are becoming more venerable to crimes and criminal activities. The overall privacy is a major concern at facebook now. The recent “Cambridge Analytica” shows us how facebook is practically selling our information to 3rd party companies for money and profit. After all it is just a bit too late to ask everyone to leave the facebook platform, because it has become a part and parcel in peoples daily life. But we can at least be just a bit careful about using it and probably care a bit less about it.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> Folk Music and Modern Music </button>
<p>Folk music and modern music together play an important part of our music with their particular differences such as origin, style, and listeners, besides their similarities. The first difference between them is the origin. While folk song is composed by general working class, each modern song is a product of an artist in personal. We can also realize that people are attracted to each kind of music by their own style. Folk music brings us to the world of peacefully beautiful countryside and benevolent people with the melodiously traditional music instruments. Modern music, on the other hand, mentions more various contents like the senses of human, happiness, sadness, or upset, for example, and even the social problems such as protecting environment, saving earth, singing the praise of peace etc. All these contents are very close to the real life, apart from some songs which are so called market- songs without meaning. As the modern music often has modern topics, the listeners of this kind of music are often the young. They feel the attraction of new music's active and sweet rhythm whenever they enjoy it. In contrast, the elders and the middle-aged like folk music than modern music as this type of music has influenced them since the very long time they were born. We can see that both modern music and folk music are important to our lives and they make this life more beautiful.</p>

<p>1.	A winter morning<br>

Winter is the coldest season in our country. It is usually foggy. Everything looks hazy Sometimes the fog is so dense that nothing can be seen even at a little distance. Everything looks hazy. Nature looks gloomy.  The chirping of the birds is not heard. The animals cannot come out of their shelters due to dense fog. Dense fog causes disruption to the communication system. Dew drops fall at night. Sometimes cold waves blow. It causes much sufferings to the children, the sick people, the aged people and the poor class. People put on different kinds of warm clothes to protect themselves from cold. Little boys & girls wrap their hands & legs in cold spell. The old people and children shiver in cold. They gather straw and make fires at different places to warm themselves in the heat. Most people do not feel like leaving the bed early. Sometimes village people spend the winter morning by gossiping.  In towns, rich people read newspaper in balcony. They drink warm tea while reading newspaper & enjoy sunbath.  The scene of the winter morning vanishes as the day advances.  In winter the days are shorter and the nights are longer. A winter night is more painful than a winter morning. A winter morning brings pains & sufferings to the rootless poor people. In spite of the dark sides of a winter morning we always welcome it because it is rich with varieties of food such as date juice, fresh vegetables and some other things. Villagers make fire with straw to warm themselves. Various kinds of pithas are made in this season. In a winter morning pitha parban is held in towns where the town folk enjoy winter food. A winter morning is not an unmixed blessing. In a winter morning, people go through different experiences according to their economic background. Those who are poor cannot afford warm cloths and so they suffer from the bitter cold. But the rich people enjoy sleep or staying under warm blanket. In cities & towns, different groups of people go picnic in remote areas & enjoy the winter morning in a different way.  So, to the poor the sun-ray becomes more precious than gold. In fact, people of all walks of life enjoy a winter morning despite some natural hazards like cold spell, dense fog etc. Many pitha  festivals are held throughout the country in  winter as the people of our country are fest lovers traditionally. The winter season is always welcome to the people of our country irrespective of class distinction. </p>

2.	Deforestation<br>
Deforestation means cutting down trees in large numbers.  It is a process where a forest becomes a non-forest.  There is no denying the fact that deforestation has become a global concern in the present world. Forests are a rich resource of our planet earth. Therefore, it is important to protect our environment. Forests have a great floral diversity. There are large trees, creepers & climbers, grasses, shrubs & bushes that grow in forests. Forests are also habitats to many wild species. A large variety of animals, birds, reptiles and insects live in forests. Forests provide sustenance to many living beings including man. There are many  causes of deforestation. Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world. Its population is much more in proportion to its area. This huge number of population needs more shelter, agricultural land, fuel, furniture etc. For all these reasons, people cut down trees. Man depends on forests for food & livelihood. As farmers need more land for cultivation, they cut down trees to expand their agricultural land.  People also cut trees for habituation. They cut down trees for timber which is used as fuel, for  construction or to make furniture. Deforestation has very drastic effects on both humans and nature. Decreasing  the number of the trees leads to rising carbon-di-oxide and lack of oxygen in the atmosphere. Deforestation results in severe health hazards like  lung diseases,  bronchitis & other respiratory diseases  in humans and animals. All living beings need water. Loss of forest leads to ecological imbalance. Deforestation is one of the major factors leading to the greenhouse effect and desertification. Moreover, there are some greedy people who cut down trees in our forests to make money. The effects of deforestation are too many to describe. This destruction disturbs our ecological balance. Due to deforestation carbon-dioxide is increasing worldwide. As a result, the world is becoming warmer. The sea level is rising. On the other hand, new areas of the world are turning into deserts as a result of deforestation. The removal of trees causes serious damage to the soil. The temperature will rise and it will cause green house effect. The country will be unsuitable for living.  Ecological balance is also disturbed by deforestation. Many wild animals and birds, as well as beasts, lose their home. Global warming is an alarming consequence of deforestation. If we destroy trees at random, one day the country will turn into a great desert. There will be no rain and  our agricultural will face a great crisis As a result temperature of the atmosphere is increasing and ice of the polar region is melting very fast. For this, we have to face various devastating floods. Drought may occur due to deforestation. Our government should take immediate measures to prevent deforestation.</p>
 
 
3.	Environment Pollution<br>

The world is producing millions of tons of domestic rubbish and toxic industrial waste each year, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable locations to get rid of all the refuse. The disposal of various kinds of waste is seriously polluting the environment. Air is an important element of our environment and our air is polluted by smoke. Man makes fires to cook food, make bricks, melt tar for road construction and to do many other things. Fires create smoke and pollute the air. Railway  engines and powerhouses create smoke by burning coal and oil. Mills and factories also belch a lot of smoke. Buses, trucks and cars use petrol and diesel oil. These too emit smoke. All these kinds of smoke pollute the air. Water, another vital element of the environment, is also polluted in different ways. Man pollutes water by throwing waste into it. Farmers use chemical fertilizers and insecticides in their fields. When rain and floods wash away some of these chemicals, they get mixed with water in rivers, canals and ponds. Mills and factories also throw their poisonous chemicals and waste products into rivers and canals and thus pollute the water. Water vehicles also pollute rivers by dumping oil, food waste and human waste into them. Every year millions of people all over the world die unnecessarily as a result of pollution. These unfortunate and avoidable deaths are brought about  by four specific factors. Firstly, air pollution from factories, burning trash, and vehicle fumes cause pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. Then, water pollution from industrial discharge. the indiscriminate disposal of toxic chemicals, and the dumping of human waste into rivers and canals causes poisoning and water-borne diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. The next factor is the noise pollution from vehicle horns and microphones that might cause aggression and damage hearing. And finally, odour pollution from dumped or untreated human waste causes serious discomfort to our sense of smell, and attracts disease-bearing creatures such as rats and flies. We should take  determined action to control these problems and clean up the environment to avert these unnecessary diseases.<br>
 
 
4.	A day labourer<br>

There is no single definition to describe a day labourer. But the word that comes to us about a day labourer is someone who works manually from early morning till  late evening on a daily basis. In short, a day labourer is he who does heavy manual labour in various fields. He belongs to the marginalized class. He belongs to ultra-poor group.  In most cases, he is unskilled or semi-skilled.  He does not enjoy due social status though he deserves it  and his labour is also  indispensible for the economic development of a country. A day labourer is a known face to all of us as he is required in our daily life. Naturally he is to be healthily, strong and stout  due to the nature of his job.  He lives with his family in a slum. He gets up early in the morning and goes out in search of work. He works hard from dawn to dusk for his employer and gets his wages at evening. He does different types of jobs such as carrying bricks, wood, stones, mud and digging ponds, constructing of roads, buildings etc. Sometimes he and his family pass a day without food if he cannot manage work. However, he is in great demand in harvesting season. . When he earns much money, he and his family can eat well. It is a happy day for them. If he does not find any work, he and his family have to go without food. So the life of a day labourer is very miserable. Sorrows and sufferings are his constant companions. He does not know what joy and happiness are. He earns his living by working hard. Most of the time he is ill- paid and ill- treated in every sphere of his life. In fact, the services of a day laborer plays an importance role in our national life. So we should think about his rights and show respect to them.<br>



5.	Price Hike<br>

Price rise is a great problem of the day. It is a common phenomenon not only in our country but also in the world. Today the prices of necessary things such as food items, cloths, education materials, medicine and many other necessary things are going up by leaps and bounds. Price rise is caused by several factors like hoarding, population explosion, low productivity, natural calamities, wars, backwardness of communication, evil motives of dishonest businessmen, smuggling, black marketing etc. If the price rise is caused by the short supply of commodities, it is temporary. But it is very difficult to control the price rise caused by inflation. However, the people of low income suffer greatly and pass their days in constant anxiety. They find it, difficult to make their both ends meet. price hike is a function of multifarious factors such as energy costs, declining dollar value, rising demand for bio-fuel, export restrictions on food grains, carrying cost, climate change, etc. Concerns over oil prices, energy security and climate change have prompted governments to encourage production and use of bio-fuel. The price rise has widened the gap between the export and import value in the food grain importing countries which has affected the terms of trade and foreign exchange reserve. The fiscal impact of this price hike leads to the reduction of taxes on food grain import and a rise in subsidies in the production of the same Price rise has terrible effects on man’s character. It leads people to the path of corruption and moral degradation. The situation is complex and there is no single solution to this problem. The government should perform more efficiently and has to take actions so that the market performs properly. Bangladesh imports a lion’s share of its import of rice from India at low cost. In Bangladesh, the main sources of calorie are rice and wheat. In spite of a rise in wheat and rice price, people still consume rice and wheat. Therefore, the food price rise affects the poor extensively. Food crisis is a national as well as an international problem.  To reduce the extent of the effect of the crisis, some short term and long term measures can be taken. The government should begin selling rice from its stock and import food grains right at this moment to keep the local market stable. The dependency on private food importers should be lessened to avoid the artificial volatility of the local markets. Increasing the adoption of hybrid rice, improving crop management practices and access to high quality seed are essential. Deepening fertilizer dealer network to improve timely access to fertilizer and focusing on high quality seed availability are also needed.. Laws should be enforced strictly to bring the prices of the essential commodities within the purchasing capacity of the common people.<br>
 


A Rainy Day<br>

 

7.	Food Adulteration<br>


Food Adulteration refers to the process by which the quality or the nature of a given food is reduced through addition of adulterants or removal of vital substance. Unsafe levels of pesticides are present  in around half of the vegetables and more than a quarter of fruits sold in the capital’s markets, a recent survey has found. The survey report, read that nearly 40% of 82 samples of milk, milk products, fish, fruits and vegetables contained banned pesticides such as DDT, Aldrin, Chlordane and Heptachlor. The amounts of pesticide in these samples were found to be 3 to 20 times greater than the limits set by the European Union. Around 50% vegetables and 35% fruits were found to be contaminated with unsafe level of pesticides. Using a sensitive High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method developed by the Food Safety Lab, 66 samples were analysed for the presence of formaldehyde. Adulteration was thereby detected in samples of coriander, mango and fresh shrimps. The tests indicated that poultry feed in the country had also been contaminated, as samples of chicken and fish contained traces of antibiotics. High microbial populations were found in several samples of pasteurised milk, indicating poor processing procedures by the manufacturers. Samples of cucumber and street foods also showed high microbial populations, suggesting widespread contamination in the water supply. Adulterated food products are reportedly the cause behind thousands of people suffering from fatal diseases like cancer, kidney failure and heart problems. Better monitoring and supervision were mandatory for stopping food adulteration.<br>
 
 

8.	A Street Hawker<br>


A street hawker is a very common man in our society. Usually he moves from place to place to sell his goods. In fact, a street hawker is a very simple man. He is very poor and humble. He is a shabby man. He is a small trader. The capital of his business is very small. He lives from hand to mouth. Every morning he goes out to sell his goods carrying them either on his hand or in a cart or van. Throughout the day, he sells his goods shouting at the top of his voice to draw the attention of his customers. A the end of the day, he returns home with  the marginal profit gained from the sold goods. Again he goes out for the next day and returns home almost in the same way. Truly speaking, he leads his life in the vicious cycle of poverty. In fact, there is no liver lining in his life. He finds it very difficult to maintain his family. He can’t afford to meet the basic needs of life. Basically, he adopts a technique to sell his goods. He applies his skill to motivate or convince his customers especially women & children who are his first priority. It is true that the importance of a hawker goes unnoticed in our society. The fact is that he belongs to the marginalized class and his business is so petty that it is not included in the mainstream economy. Still he is part & parcel of our society. So we should have positive mindset for him.<br>
 
 


9.	Traffic Jam<br>

Traffic jam means a long line of vehicles that cannot move or that can move very slowly. It is a common affair in the big cities of our country. We’ve all experienced being stuck in a traffic jam, a stream of cars for miles ahead of us and behind us. Lack of co-ordination among government organizations and haphazard public transport system which includes lack of provision for pedestrians and poor maintenance and management of footways are the root cause of traffic jam. Rapid growth of population and the increasing number of vehicles are also the causes of traffic jam. Vehicles are much more than the roads can accommodate. The indiscriminate playing of rickshaw is another cause of it. Haphazard parking, more private vehicles, violation of traffic rules, faulty road construction, haphazard crossing, VIP movement, over population, rail crossing and fuel station are also the causes of traffic jam in the big cities city. Traffic jam causes untold sufferings to people. Sometimes it raises our tension. Transport and urban experts think the government should take pragmatic steps to ensure sufficient mass transport, restore discipline in the transport sector, reduce the use of private and small vehicles, replace the microbuses and minibuses with single-decker, double-decker and articulated buses and expand the capital city to significantly ease the traffic jam without spending huge money. The railways and waterways can also be used effectively to ease traffic pressure on roads and facilitate the commuters hassle-free transportation services. We have built over a half dozens of flyovers, but it is not a solution to the problem. It will not be possible to reduce traffic jam without increasing public transport and ensuring better traffic management. It is also necessary to implement all mass transit-related projects with high priority to improve traffic situation.<br>
 
 


10.	Load shedding<br>

The term ‘load shedding’ means the state of being no electricity due to demand supply gap of power for a certain period in a certain area. The energy infrastructure of Bangladesh is quite small, insufficient and poorly managed. Electricity is the major source of power for most of the economic activities of a country. In generating & distributing power, the failure to adequately manage the loads leads to load-shedding which causes severe disruption in the industrial production and other economic activities. Inefficient distribution system is a major hurdle in delivering power. It is estimated that the total transmission and distribution losses in Bangladesh amount to one-third of the total generation. The process of upgrading the grid technology to digital smart metering system is going on throughout the country to reduce system loss. It will reduce power cuts and provide stability to the power sector. Radio technology can be operated remotely to maintain multiple power flow lines with automated control & digital metering. Load shedding causes multiple hazards in our socio-economic life. During load shedding the whole area plunges into darkness. Houses, shops, mills, factories, hospitals & almost all infrastructures are paralyzed for the time being. Students cannot prepare their lessons. Doctors cannot operate upon emergency patients in hospitals. Mills & factories cannot run their machines. Farmers cannot operate their agricultural tools in corn fields. Everything comes to a stand-still due to load-shedding. So, pragmatic steps should be taken to reduce system loss & keep load shedding at a tolerable level. The old power plants should be replaced. Nuclear plant is the best solution to power crisis to  meet the growing demand of the consumers. Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is an under construction nuclear power plant in our country. It is expected that power crisis is going to be solved in Bangladesh.<br>

  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
 
Once there lived three friends. They were very greedy. One day they were going through a forest. In the forest, they saw a bag lying on the ground. They picked it up and found a lot of gold coins in it. They became overjoyed and decided to divide the gold coins equally among themselves. As they got tired & hungry  due to their long journey in the forest , they stopped at a place in the forest  & decided to search for food to satisfy their hunger. One of the friends went to the near-by market to fetch some food.  While he was seeking food, the other two friends plotted against him. They hit upon a plan to kill their first friend on his return from the market so that they could grab all the gold coins. On the other hand, while going to the market, the first friend thought to himself that the food should be poisoned so that he alone could grab the whole share of gold coins. So, he mixed poison with the food & returned to the forest with the poisoned food. But as soon as he returned to the spot, the other two friends killed him mercilessly. They felt free and sat together to eat the food without any doubt about its being poisoned. They started eating the poisoned food & within a short time, they were poisoned to death. As a consequence of their greed, the bag of gold coins remained lying on the ground but none of the friends was alive to claim the bag. Thus their greed resulted in sin and death.

  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
   
One day King Solomon, the wise judge was in his court. At that time two women entered into the court with a baby. Both of the women claimed the baby of their own. They demanded fair judgment to king Solomon. The king puzzled for some time for what to do though he was reputed for his wisdom and fair judgment. He thought for a while. Suddenly, he ordered one of his men to cut the baby into two equal parts and give one part to each of the women. The king noticed one woman turned into pale hearing his discussion. She burst into tears and said,” Please my lord, don’t kill the baby. I don’t want my share. Allow the baby to live with her.” On the other hand, the other woman was silent. She promptly said, “Yes, my lord, please give the baby to me. I am its mother.” 
The wise judge understood who the real mother was. A real mother never keeps silent at the time of any danger of her baby. He returned the baby to the first woman who was the real mother and sent the 2nd woman to the prison as punishment.   
Moral of the story: Truth comes to the light at last. Nothing can hide the truth.

It was too heavy for him to move.When he was just about to fly in despair, he thought of a plan. Suddenly his eyes fell upon some pebbles lying near the pitcher. He flew to them, picked up the pebbles one by one and dropped them into the pitcher Slowly and slowly the level of water rose and came up to the beak. The crow was overjoyed to see this. He dipped his beak, quenched his thirst and flew away.

Abdul Qadir Jilani was an eminent Islamic scholar born in 11th century in Persia. At the age of eighteen, he asked for  permission from his mother to travel to Baghdad to pursue his education. Baghdad then was the hub of political, commercial and cultural activity, and the center of  learning. On hearing this, his mother was more than happy to send her son off to follow the path of higher learning. It was for such a purpose that she had saved forty gold coins for her son. As she prepared supplies for his journey, she sewed the coins into the lining of his coat for safekeeping. Before Abdul Qadir joined the caravan of merchants to travel to Baghdad, her parting advice to her son was, “Whenever you speak, speak the truth.  In route to Baghdad the caravan was assaulted by a band of robbers. While searching, the robbers asked Abdul Qadir, “Do you have anything valuable?’ Abdul Qadir calmly replied, “Yes.” On hearing this, the robbers franticaly searched further but could not find anything. The robbers took Abdul Qadir to their leader and said, “This boy says he has valuables but I cannot find anything .” The leader of the robbers asked Abdul Qadir, “Are you hiding any valuables?”Again Abdul Qadir answered, “Yes.”The robber asked, “What are you hiding?”Abdul Qadir replied, “Forty gold coins.” Upon further searching, the robber discovered the coins hidden in the lining of Abdul Qadir’s coat. The robber was now curious to know more about this boy who was not afraid and insisted on speaking the truth. The robber asked, “What is your name and where do you come from?” He replied, “My name is Abdul Qadir and I come from the province of Jilan in Persia.” “Where are you going?” “I am going to Baghdad.” “What do you plan to do in Baghdad?”“I want to study with the greatest scholars to gain knowledge.” On hearing this, the leader of the robbers was stunned with remorse and embraced Abdul Qadir  asking for his forgiveness.

But peacocks understood easily that actually he was a crow in the appearance of a peacock. All peacocks gathered together and attacked him. They pulled out all the false feathers and drove him away. Finding no other way he returned to the crows. But the crows did not accept him. They also drove him away. The crows realized his fault. So, he apologized to all the crows.

Once there lived two rats in a house. One day they stole a piece of bread from that house. The bread was so delicious that they began to quarrel between them as to how to divide it equally. At last they decided to go to a monkey for equal division of the bread. But the monkey was very greedy & clever. At first  it tore the piece of bread into two pieces  & put the two halves onto the scales of a balance. But it was found that one piece was larger than the other. So, it bit off a portion from the larger piece of bread to make it equal to the other smaller piece.  But this the smaller piece turned into the larger one & the larger piece turned into the smaller one. So he again did the same thing to make the two halves equal. But to their utter surprise, they found that both the halves became smaller & smaller gradually.  At one stage there was only one single small piece of bread left for the two rats.  This time both the rats came to their senses. They at once shouted at the greedy, clever monkey to stop its idiosyncrasy & demanded that they be given back the last piece of bread left.  But the greedy, clever monkey refused to give them back the last piece of bread left.  It claimed that it was its own piece as it toiled much to divide the bread equally.  Thus the two rats lost their piece of bread for ever due to their lack of reciprocal unity & faith on each other.

Once upon a time there was a king of Scotland named Robert the Bruce who was both brave and wise. The King of England was at war with him, and led a great army into Scotland to drive him out of the land and to make Scotland a part of England. Battle after battle,  he had fought with England. Six times Robert the Bruce had led his brave little army against his foes. Six times his men had been beaten, until finally they were driven into flight. At last the army of Scotland was entirely scattered, and the king was forced to hide in the woods and in lonely places among the mountains. One rainy day, Robert the Bruce lay in a cave, listening to the rainfall outside the cave . He was tired and felt sick at heart, ready to give up all hope. It seemed to him that there was no use for him trying to do anything more. As he was thinking, he noticed a spider over his head, getting ready to weave her web. He watched her as she worked slowly and with great care. Six times she tried to throw her thread from one edge of the cave wall to another. Six times her thread fell short. But the spider did not lose hope. With still more care, she made ready to try for the seventh time. Robert the Bruce almost forgot his own troubles as he watched.  Fascinated, she swung herself out upon the slender line. The thread was carried safely to the cave wall and fastened there. “Yes!” cried Bruce, “I, too, will try a seventh time!”  So he arose and called his men together. He told them of his plans, and sent them out with hopeful messages to cheer the discouraged people. Soon there was an army of brave men around him. A seventh battle was fought, and this time the King of England was forced to retreat back to his own country.

  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
   
The town of Hamelin was once full of rats. They ate all the food, troubled sleeping babies, and made a lot of noise. The people had grown tired of the rats but were unable to do anything. Even the cats were not able to kill the rats  .One day, a queer fellow with piercing eyes, came to the  town. He was called the Pied Piper. He went to the Mayor and asked him, “What will you pay me if I free your town of every single rat?” The Mayor offered fifty pounds to the Pied Piper. Happy with the offer, the Pied Piper started playing his pipe. Hearing the shrill, keen note, every rat came out from its hole and started following him. The Pied Piper kept on playing his pipe and the rats followed him.  The Piper walked up to the harbour with millions of rats behind him and led them into the water and waited till every rat sank down into the river. Now the town was free of the little devils and the people were very happy.
After all the rats were dead, the Pied Piper returned and asked the Mayor for his money. The Mayor said that he could only give him twenty pounds for such an easy job. Now the rats being  dead, the Mayor thought that there was nothing to worry about. But the Pied Piper wanted to teach him a lesson. This time he played a different tune. Hearing his music, the children came out of their houses. They started following the Piper, dancing and shouting. The elders watched in disbelief as the Pied Piper led the children far, far away. The Mayor sent his men to look for the Piper and bring the children back but none could find the lost children.

Once the house of a rich man was infested with rats. The house became like the town of Hamelin. There were rats everywhere. They were doing a lot of mischief there. They enjoyed so much freedom that they started taking away foods, cutting cloths and making holes here and there. The member of the house could not take a sound sleep at all. Even sometimes, the mice became so aggressive that they started biting the babies.  The master of the house became very annoyed at this and lost his patience. At last he hit upon a plan. He bought a cat to kill the mice. The cat started killing the mice one by one. As a result, all the mice got frightened and could not move as before. In this situation, they sat in a conference to get rid of the cat. Many proposals were made but none of those were acceptable. At last a young mouse rose up and said, “I have a good plan. Let us tie a bell around the neck of the cat. When the cat  will come, we can be able to save ourselves by hearing the sound of the bell.” All the mice thanked him for his good plan. But an old mouse said, “Certainly the plan is good. But who will bell the cat? Hearing this all the mice remained silence. So, the conference ended in smoke and eventually they left the house to save their own lives.

A nurse was there to look after the two childbearing mothers. At the time of delivery, the nurse allowed none in the house. The nurse found that one woman bore a baby boy but she became senseless just after the birth of the child. On the other hand, the other woman bore a dead baby boy and she was in a pensive mood for bearing a dead child. She at once hit upon a plan. She somehow managed the nurse and replaced her dead child by the alive of that woman. After a few minutes, the woman got her sense and cried out loudly seeing the dead child beside her. She could not believe that this dead child was hers. She became almost mad about what to do because she was very sure that there was something wrong. The nurse told a lie about the two children .Finding no other way, the woman went to the Quazi for Justice. The Quazi listened to the woman’s prayer. Then, he summoned the two women. He asked them to let him know the truth. Both the women claimed for the alive baby boy. At least, the Quazi hit upon a plan. He decided to solve the problem technically. He informed both the women that he would cut the baby into two equal pieces and give one piece to each of them. At this, the real mother of the baby burst into tears and said, “Your majesty, please, don’t kill my baby. Allow it to live and gave it to that woman so that I may feel that my baby is still alive with her. The false mother on the other hand kept silent  & did not utter even a single word.

She appeared before him and asked the reason of his crying. The wood-cutter told her of his misfortune. After hearing all, the water-goddess dived into water and brought a golden axe. Seeing the axe, the wood-cutter told that it was not his own. The water-goddess dived again and came out with a silver axe. The wood-cutter refused to take it as it was not his axe too. For the third time, the water-goddess went back into water and came back with his real iron-made axe with wooden handle. “That’s mine”, the wood-cutter cried out gaily. He became very delighted and thanked her. The water-goddess impressed most seeing the honesty of the poor wood-cutter and offered him all other two precious axes as reward. Thus honesty is rewarded Everywhere.

23. The Scholar And The Boatman Story
There was a poor boatman in a village. He was illiterate. He used to row boat from morning till evening only to meet his both ends. There was no meaning of knowledge to him. It was the month of Baishakh. A scholar got into his boat. He was enjoying his journey very much because the weather was very fine. It was almost dark. He was gossiping with the boatman.  “Did you have any knowledge about the creation of the universe?” the scholar asked the boatman. “No,” replied the boatman. The scholar got astonished and told him, “Without the knowledge of astronomy half of your life is spoiled The boatman was sad and thought of the uselessness of his life. He again asked the boatman, “Do you know about the history of human civilization? The reply of the boatman was the same as before. This time the scholar told the boatman that he had already spoilt three -fourths of his life and he could not come to any use to the society. The boatman kept silent and went on a rowing boat in a sad mood. Suddenly, the weather became gusty. The sky was overcast with clouds. There was darkness all around. There was also heavy showers with lightning. The boat was about to capsize. The scholar was trembling with fear, But the boatman was very quiet because he was used to this weather. He asked the scholar. “Sir, do you know how to swim?’ The scholar replied, crying, “No”. “Now the boatman said, Alas! Your life is totally spoilt. Pray to God for your safety.”






24. Slow And Steady Wins The Race 
A hare is a very speedy animal. It can run very fast. But a tortoise moves very slowly. It has a heavy shell on its back. Its legs are short. So, it can’t move as first as other animals. Once upon a time, a hare was very proud of his speed and cut a joke at a tortoise.One day she said to a tortoise, “I pity you for your speed.” “How can you walk with such a heavy shell on your back?” “You need not worry friend, hare,” said the tortoise. “If you like, I can run a race with you.” The hare sneered, “What do you want to run a race! Very well, I am ready. I accept your challenge.” At one, both of them started. In a moment the hare got ahead of the tortoise. The tortoise was moving very slowly with his heavy shell on his back.

25. A fox without a tail

Once there was a clever fox in a jungle. One day, when the fox was walking through a jungle, he fell into a trap. He could somehow get out of the trap, but he had to leave his tail behind. Without a tail, he looked strange and he felt sad. But the fox was very cunning and he hit upon a plan. He invited all the foxes to come to a meeting. When they had assembled together, the Fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails. He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies Then the fox said, “My dear friends, I’ve invented a new thing, the tails of ours are useless. They look ugly and are always dirty. So, we should cut off our tails.”
All the foxes listened to the cunning fox. One of the wise old foxes was also listening. He said, “My friend, your plan is very interesting but foolish. As you’ve lost your tail, you want us to cut off our tails. I do not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself.” The clever fox being ashamed fled away from the spot.

<p  style="color: deep black; text-alignment:center; back-ground-color:red ; outline: 4px; border: 2px solid black">1.	Dialogue Between Two Friends on Frequent Road Accidents
Rahim: Hello, Kamal, why do you look gloomy?.<br>
Kamal: Today I have seen the news of a tragic road accident.<br>
Rahim: But the road accident is a daily affair in our country.<br>
Kamal: Maybe. But this news has shocked me terribly.<br>
Rahim: Of course. Every road accident is a tragic news in deed.<br>
Kamal: It is reported that all the five members of  the ill-fated family died on the spot while    they were going to attend a wedding party.<br>
Rahim: How did the accident take place?
Kamal: While the car carrying five members was coming towards Dhaka, a loaded truck was going from opposite direction and collided with the car near Faridpur town.<br>
Rahim: What a pity it is!
Kamal: Can you tell me the reasons for frequent road accidents in our country?<br>
Rahim: So far, I could know from newspapers and other electronic media, most of the accidents take place due to the reckless driving, non-compliance of traffic rules, unfit vehicles and poor infrastructure  of existing road system etc.<br>
Kamal: Can you please tell me how we can control and reduce the number of road accidents?
Rahim: Immediate steps should be taken to reduce traffic jam. The overall traffic   management should be digitalized. Central monitoring should be introduced to navigate the ongoing traffic system with the help of GPS. Besides, number plate can be digital with the help of RFID.<br>
Kamal: That’s good. Who will do that?
Rahim: Obviously it is the responsibility of the government to implement the existing law & introduce effective measures in the best possible way. <br>
Kamal: No, it is not the responsibility of the government alone. Rather it is the responsibility of all concerned including the government to solve this problem.<br>
Rahim: Yes, right you are. We should also create awareness among the general people as well the drivers to follow traffic rules.<br>
Kamal: By implementing modern & sophisticated ICT based traffic  controlling system we can reduce traffic accidents in our country.<br>
Rahim: Thanks for information.
Kamal: Thank you too.</P>

<h3 >2.	Write a Dialogue about how to Eradicate Illiteracy </h3>

<p  style=" border: 2px solid black;">Shafiq    : Hi Rafiq, how are you? <br>

Rafiq    : I’m fine. And you?<br> 

Shafiq   : I’m fine too. But I’m much tensed about the education system & mass illiteracy rate of our country.<br> 

Rafiq  :  Without education no nation can develop. Education means self-enlightenment. It is the acquisition of knowledge, skill, ability, belief & habit.<br>
 
Shafiq   : What should we do then?<br>

Rafiq  : We should work hard  to educate the illiterate.<br>

Shafiq : We also need to create people’s awareness so that they  send their
children to school.<br>

Rafiq  : Yes, of course. It’s the key factor. Our government has already taken some steps to remove illiteracy.<br>


Shafiq : But there are some people in our society who are very poor. They are unwilling to send their children to school owing to poverty.<br>

Rafiq :  Indeed! It’s quite so. To persuade the poor people to send their children to school the government has also started ‘Food for Education’ programme.<br>

Shafiq : Yes, it is an epoch-making step.<br>

Rafiq  : But the govt. alone can not solve the problem. Every educated person including students must come forward to educate the illiterate.

Shafiq : Of course. To make the programme a success we must co-operate each other.<br>

Rafiq  : If we are sincere in our words and deeds, nothing is impossible.<br>

Shafiq : That’s right. Thank you.<br>

Rafiq  : Ok. See you again </P>

05. Write a dialogue between you & your friend about the importance of tree plantation
Myself : Good morning. How are you?
Zahid : I am fine. Where are you going now?
Myself : I’m going to Osmani Milanaytan to attend a seminar on the importance of tree 	plantation.
Zahid : Would you please tell me about the importance of tree plantation?
Myself: Trees are of a great importance to us. We cannot think of our existence without 	trees. They are a great source of life & living on earth.
Zahid: But have you marked that many people are cutting trees at random? What might 	be its consequence?
Myself : If  trees are cut down indiscriminately, the country will one day turn into a 	desert. The temperature will rise and cause greenhouse effect.
Zahid  : What should we do to save our environment from pollution?
Myself: We should plant more trees. But there are many people who are not aware of 	the importance of tree plantation.
Zahid: Right you are. In order to make people aware of the importance of trees, 	tree plantation programme should be expanded.

Myself: Is it enough? We have to take eco-friendly measures to boost tree plantation program.
Zahid: I don’t understand. What do you mean to say by eco-friendly measures?
Myself: I mean to say that we have to reduce pollution by organic food plantation & by the least use of chemical fertilizer. 
Zahid : I agree with you, my friend. Thank you for your discussion.
Myself	 : You are most welcome.












06	A Dialogue between two friends about the preparation for half yearly examination
Sujon: Hello Hasib, how are you?
Hasib: I am fine, and what about you?
 Sujon: I am not so good. I am worried about my exam.
Hasib: It is very common. You are serious about it, so you are worried.
 Sujon: Don't philosophize, please. I am really afraid as I have no good preparation for English. 	In a short time it is very difficult for me to make a success in English.
Hasib: I think your English learning method is not so good. You should learn some basic rules of 	English if you want to do well in English.
 Sujon: You are right. Besides, I should improve my writing skill to do well in English.
 Hasib: It is okay. You will do better if you read English regularly.
 Sujon: Thank you for your encouragement. To speak the truth, I am afraid as I couldn't secure 	more than 50% marks in English in the last examination.
 Hasib: No matter. You are a good student. I hope you would be able to make up for the loss.
Sujon: Now tell me about your preparation.
Hasib: I paid equal attention to all the subjects. So, I am not worried about any particular 	subject. Now I am revising all the subjects.
Sujon: Very well. You are always studious and laborious. You did not waste your time. You 	have also made a good preparation.
Hasib: Do not mention it. But it is true that I read regularly and emphasize on all subjects equally.
 Sujon: Excellent! Hope you will do better in the examination. Thank you.
 Hasib: You are most welcome. Hope you will also do better.








07.	Write a Dialogue between you and your friend about good effects/benefits of morning walk.

Mabrur : Hi Masrur, it is already 8 a.m. and you are just brushing your teeth. What’s the matter? 
	
Masrur: No matter, friend. Today I could not rise early. 

Mabrur : It matters, friend. I think you are  a late riser. I never saw you walking in the morning. 

Masrur: Not exactly that, Mabrur. Frankly speaking I do try but fail. 

Mabrur : I’m sorry for you, boy. You are deprived of the benefits of morning walk. 

Masrur: Morning walk! I’ve always been interested in  walking  in the open air at morning. Could you tell me more about it? 

Mabrur : With pleasure, Masrur. Morning walk gives us invaluable benefits but costs us nothing. It makes you feel fresh and lively all the day. You can breathe in pure oxygen which keeps your respiration OK. It is also the best kind of exercise. 

Masrur: All are true but why are you forgetting about the serene natural beauty of morning what attracts me most. 

Mabrur : Oh, no Masrur. Actually I like to say there are few people who find nature enjoyable. 

Masrur:  The rising sun in the east horizon, bird chirping in trees and cool gentle blowing breeze seem to be the best gifts of God. What do you think? 

Mabrur : Ah! You are talking as if you were a poet. I do agree, brother.

Rakib: Hello, Rajib, good morning. How are you?
Myself: I am fine and you?
Rakib: I am not so fine. 	
Myself: What’s wrong with you? 
Rakib: I always feel weak. I am rather unwell.
Myself: Have you got any disease?
Rakib: Not that. In fact, I can’t go on well with any work. I feel feeble & clumsy.
Myself: I think you do not take physical exercise.
Rakib: You are right. Actually I do not find any time in doing so.
Myself: But you must know the importance of taking physical exercise.
Rakib: Yes. Do you think I should take regular physical exercise?
Myself: Obviously. Taking physical exercise makes a man fit for work. It circulates blood. Human body is like a machine. So, all the parts of the body should be kept active by taking regular physical exercise.
Rakib: Would you please tell me about some more importance of taking physical exercise?
Myself: Sure. Health is wealth. Regular physical exercise removes the weakness of the body. It makes mind cheerful. Physical exercise is essential for keeping in good health.
Rakib: Thank you for your good advice.

9. Write a Dialogue between two friends about the bad effects of smoking.

Ershad : Hi Liton, Let’s go to playground.

Liton: Yes, I’m also waiting for you.

Ershad : What about you? You aren’t going to school for a few days.

Liton: Just wait. Let me buy a cigarette from that shop.

Ershad : What! Cigarette! Oh, yes. I’ve heard you have become a chain smoker nowadays.

Liton: No brother. Not just so. I smoke now and then.

Ershad: Why do you smoke, Liton? Don’t you know smoking is harmful for health?

Liton: Oh, you don’t know. When you smoke, you look smart and full of personality. Smoking also removes tiredness.

Ershad : But there are many bad effects of smoking. Don’t you know that? Smoking is like taking poison!

Liton: What bad effect! Many a man is smoking everyday here and there.

Ershad : But it may cause you serious diseases like cancer, heart attack, bronchitis etc. It also damages your lung and causes lung cancer.

Liton: That’s are heard, friend but nobody dies from smoking.

Ershad : What! Nobody dies! According to World Health Organization (WHO) 5 million people die every year from tobacco related illness. That is about one person is dying in every 6 second. Smokers are likely to die at least 10 years earlier than the non-smokers.

Liton: Really! In true sense, I never thought so much. Moreover I never knew such a dangerous effect of smoking. I just started to smoke out of curiosity.

Ershad : And this curiosity is spoiling your character and gradually leading you to death.

Liton: Sure, Ershad. I promise I’ll give up smoking from this very day. You have saved me from a great danger.

Ershad : And never indulge such a bad habit





10. A dialogue between two friends on the advantages and disadvantages of village life and  city life.
Nasir: Hello, Sagir. How’re you?
Myself  : I am very well and you?
Nasir: I’m also well. I came to know that you can’t adjust to city life. But why? 
Myself: Yes, I have  got bored in city life.
Nasir	: What are the things of city life that you don’t like?
Myself: Life in city seems to me very artificial. It’s full of din and bustle. 	People lead a very 	busy life in polluted environment. They wake up from sleep in the morning hearing 	the sound of vehicles, machines and factories.
Nasir: Right you are. But there are many modern facilities you can have in city 	life. In cities   	there are many good educational institutions, hospitals and clinics. There are also 	many    	recreational places in  the city.          
Myself: That’s true. But to me life in the village is far better than that in the city. Village life is  	quite natural and the people in the village lead a very simple life. They wake up from  	sleep in the morning hearing the melodious songs of birds.  
Nasir: But village life is not free from disadvantages. Disease, hunger, malnutrition and 	poverty are common in the life of the villagers.     
Myself: Actually both the lives have their advantages and disadvantages. A balanced 	development  can remove the gap between two types of life.
Nasir: If we debate on the topic our discussion will never end. 
Myself: It is true. It is a great concept. 	
Nasir:  Exactly so. I agree with you. 
Myself  : Thank you for your discussion.
Nasir:  You are most welcome.
Myself:  You are also welcome.

Myself: Hi, Anik! How are you?
Anik: I am fine. And you?
Myself: I am fine too. Where are you going hastily?
Anik: I am going to buy a newspaper from the stall. The newsboy didn’t come to deliver 	newspaper today.
Myself:: Is there any special news today?
Anik: Not for any special news in deed.  It’s my hobby to read newspaper.
Myself: Do you read any newspaper regularly?
Anik: Yes, of course. 
Myself: It’s nice. I also read newspaper daily. Do you think  reading  newspaper regularly is 	essential? 
Anik: Certainly. In fact, it’s the storehouse of knowledge.
Myself: What can you learn from it?
Anik: We can learn about trade & commerce, politics, games & sports etc from it.
Myself: I don’t miss to read the pages that are written especially for the students.
Anik: I also read such types of pages minutely. I think that such pages help us take good 	preparation for the exam.
Myself: You are right. Actually everyone should read newspapers daily. 
Anik: A man who does not read newspaper is like a frog in a narrow well.
Myself: You are right . Thanks a lot.
Anik: Welcome.

Myself: Good morning, Monir! How are you? <br>
Monir: Good morning. Thanks. I am nice and you?
Myself: I am also fine. I am very glad about your brilliant result in the SSC Examination. Would you tell me about your aim in life?<br>
Monir: I have already made up my mind to study law. I’ll join politics after completing my   studies. I wish to serve my countrymen by driving away restless politics.<br>
Myself: All these are true. But it is really a difficult task.
Monir: You’re right. But don’t forget that nothing is impossible for me. A patriotic leader can stamp out all kinds of corruption and injustice froth society. Please, bless for’ me.<br>
Myself: I am very glad about this. I am sure that we will be able to eradicate evil politics from the country.<br>
Monir: What’s your aim in life?<br>
Myself:  I want to be a doctor.<br>
Monir: Why have you chosen this profession? <br>
Myself: Oh sure. I give you an example. Most of the people in our country are very poor. They cannot afford the expenses of treatment. As a result, many of them die only for want of proper and timely treatment.<br>
Monir: In that case, how can you help them?
Myself: I want to offer treatment to poor people free of cost. And I dream that if I can earn more money, I will set up a charitable dispensary for the poor.<br>
Monir: That’s a very good idea. But you know, getting admitted into medical colleges has become so tough nowadays. What’s your plan regarding that?<br>
Myself: I know that academic excellence is very much important for getting admitted to a medical college. So, I am trying my best to achieve that success.<br>
Monir: I appreciate your aim and your heartiest effort to make your dream true. I wish you all the best.<br>
Myself: Thank you very much.<br>
Monir: You’re most welcome.<br>
Myself  : It’s wonderful!<br>
Monir : Yes, it’s essential for human resource and development.<br>
Myself  : Yours is also an excellent idea.<br>

Rakib: Hello, Rajib, good morning. How are you?
Myself:  Good morning. I am fine and you?
Rajib:  I am also fine. But I am a little bit confused about the importance of learning English. Would you please share your ideas with me about it?
Myself: Why not? We all know English is an international language. It is also a global language.
Rajib:  But it is not our first language. So, is it very essential for us to learn English other than mother tongue?
Myself: Obviously. English is not only an international language  but also an official & semi-official language in more than 60 countries of the world. It is the language of science & technology.
Rakib: OK, I understand. Please tell me about the importance of English in other fields like job, education, professional life & so on.
Myself: Sure. In the job market especially in multi-national companies as well as international organizations a candidate without sufficient working knowledge of English is not desirable.  Besides, in overseas education, a prospective student needs band score 7 or more in IELTS  for admission into undergraduate & post-graduate levels in prestigious institutions. In short, we can not do a single day without English in this competitive world.
Rakib: Very nice. You have opened my eyes. We really need English to cope with the present world.
Myself: I agree with you on this point. So, let’s focus on English to build up career.
Rakib: Thank you for your good advice. I must emphasize the importance of learning English.
Myself: That’s good. See you. Take care.
