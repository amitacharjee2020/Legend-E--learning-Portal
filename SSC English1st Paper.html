Part A: (50 Marks)<br>
Read the passage & answer the following questions.<br>  
  May Day or International Workers Day is observed on May 1 all over the world today to commemorate the historical struggle and sacrifices of the working people to establish an eight-hour workday. It is a public holiday in almost all the countries of the world. Since the Industrial Revolution(1) in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the US, the workers in mills and factories had been working a long shift, fourteen or even more hours a day. On May 1st in 1886, inspired by the trade unions(2), half of the workers at the  Mc Cormic Harvester Company in Chicago went on strike demanding an eight-hour workday. Two days later, a workers’ rally was held near the Mc Cormic Harvester Company and about 6000 workers had joined it. The rally was addressed by the labour leaders. They urged the workers to stand together, to go on with their struggle and not to give in to their bosses. Just at this moment some strikebreakers started leaving the meeting place. The strikers went down the street to bring them back. Suddenly about 200 policemen attacked them with clubs and revolvers. One striker was killed instantly, five or six others were seriously wounded and many of them were badly injured. The events of May 1, 1886 is a reminder that workers will continue to be exploited until they stand up and speak out to gain better working conditions, better pay and better lives

Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline,
according to survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds).
 It’s a charitable organisation registered in England and Wales. 
 The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor experiences than their counterparts over 55, according to a survey by RSPB.
 People were asked which of 12 outdoor experiences they could remember during their childhood. 
 The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees, playing conkers and feeding birds.
 Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same number of girls made daisy chains. 
 But the survey showed the numbers declining among the newer generations.
 Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had these outdoor experiences in their childhood,
 compared with those between 15-34 years old. Some 92% of the public agreed that 
 experiences of nature were still important to children, and 82% agreed that schools should play a role in providing them to all children.
 The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's education, health, wellbeing and social skills.
 At the same time, there has been a decline in these opportunities, with negative consequences for children, 
 families and society - a condition now known as nature deficit disorder. Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, 
 will meet parliament members on Tuesday to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children with first-hand experiences
 of the natural environment. … "We believe this guidance should include the many positive impacts to children of having
 contact with nature and learning outside the classroom." <br>
